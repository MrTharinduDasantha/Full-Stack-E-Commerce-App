# Full Stack E-Commerce Website

In this project, I will make a Full-stack e-commerce website using React JS, Node JS, Express JS, MongoDB, and Stripe payment gateway. 

In this e-commerce website project, user can explore products, filter and sort the product and user can add the product to the cart by selecting product variants like size. Users can also order the product by providing the delivery address and using any payment method either cash on delivery or stripe online payment method. So that customer can pay online and place the order.

I will build the admin dashboard of this e-commerce website so that admin can upload the product, delete the product or check all products added on the store. I will build this e-commerce backend project / backend api's using node js and express js and all products, users and order data will be stored on mongo db database.
